# Usage

Suppose you want to remove all artifacts older than N days from 'reponame'.
You should take the following steps:

1. Install `artifactory-cleanup`
2. Ð¡reate a python file, for example, `reponame.py` with the following contents:
```python
from artifactory_cleanup import rules
from artifactory_cleanup.rules import CleanupPolicy

RULES = [

    # ------ ALL REPOS --------
    CleanupPolicy(
       'Delete files older than 30 days',
        rules.repo('reponame'),
        rules.delete_older_than(days=30),
    ),
]
```
3. Run the command to SHOW (not remove) artifacts that will be deleted:
```bash
artifactory-cleanup --user user --password password --artifactory-server https://repo.example.com/artifactory --config reponame.py
```
4. Add `--destroy` flag to REMOVE artifacts
```bash
artifactory-cleanup --destroy --user user --password password --artifactory-server https://repo.example.com/artifactory --config reponame.py
```

## Commands ##

```

## Available Rules ##

All rules are imported from the `rules` module.
See also [List of available cleaning rules](docs/RULES)

## Artifact cleanup policies ##

To add a cleaning policy you need:

- Create a python file, for example, `reponame.py`. `artifacroty-cleanup` imports the variable `RULES`, so you can make a python package.
- Add a cleanup rule from the [available cleanup rules](docs/RULES).

```python
from artifactory_cleanup import rules
from artifactory_cleanup.rules import CleanupPolicy

RULES = [

    CleanupPolicy(
       'Delete all * .tmp repositories older than 7 days',
        rules.repo_by_mask('*. tmp'),
        rules.delete_older_than(days = 7),
    ),
    CleanupPolicy(
        'Delete all images older than 30 days from docker-registry exclude latest, release',
        rules.repo('docker-registry'),
        rules.exclude_docker_images(['*:latest', '*:release*']),
        rules.delete_docker_images_not_used(days=30),
    ),
]
```

## Helm Chart Usage ##

Make sure you have (helm installed)[https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/]!  
Put your rules.py, containing your [cleanup rules](#available-rules), into the helm chart folder (besides `Chart.yaml`).  
Create a copy of `values.yaml` called `answer.yaml` in the same folder.  
In the `answer.yaml` remove everything but the values you want to overwrite.  
There you should also provide your credentials and the Artifactory URL in the `artifactoryCleanupConfig` section.  
On your terminal, navigate to the helm chart folder and install the chart using the following command:  

```bash
    helm upgrade -i <release name> . -n <namespace> -f answer.yaml
    # e.g.: helm upgrade -i artifactory-cleanup . -n artifactory-cleanup -f answer.yaml
```
